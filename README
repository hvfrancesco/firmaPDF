This is the OpenSignPDF 0.0.x README file.

Here is a download link for the OpenSignPDF Project on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67103&package_id=188602

We currently provide in this file only instructions
on how to compile and run the OpenSignPDF 0.0.x project. 

Requirements:
0) You will need a PKCS#11 smartcard supported by your system, and a running
PCSC service on it ("smart card" service on Windows, pcscd daemon on *nix systems) 

1) You should have JDK 1.4.x installed on your machine if you want to
compile the source files (see the project's ./src folder)

2) If you just want to run the already compiled classes 
(see the project's ./bin folder ) you don't need a JDK 1.4.x.
What you need is:
- a JRE 1.4.x (JDK 1.4.x   bundle includes it). 
- Read also the note about PKCS11 wrapper native library at point 3.
- You will have to replace the file CA.cer in the root directory of the project
  with the root certificate of the authority that issued your signing certificate.

NOTE: I am using JDK 1.5.0 Update 8 which can be 
downloaded from Sun's web site. Take a look at: 
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

3) The following libraries are needed to build and run  
the project's source files (A version of them is already in the /lib 
sub directory, you will also need to download and put on the library path 
of your system the native library of the iaik PKCS#11 wrapper 
in order to make your smart card accessible to the program):
		
	3.1) The iText package, which is a free Java API
	for PDF files creation and manipulation. This library is 
	available for download under the following location:
	http://www.lowagie.com/iText/download.html
		
	3.2) The iaik.jar file contains the IAIK (Technical University of Graz, Austria): 
	PKCS#11 Wrapper, which makes your PKCS11 library (cryptoki) available from JavaTM.
	You can find more information and download a recent version from 
	http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/products/core_crypto_toolkits/pkcs_11_wrapper.
	
4) The libraries described in 3) should be enough for compiling
and running (remember the native library from IAIK) the OpenSignPDF
 0.0.x project. Note that we have included a .cmd file as well ( sign.cmd ) 
in the project's root directory. 
If you are using a Windows PC you may use it to run a simple GUI 
which permits you to sign a pdf file of your choice (provided that 
you have a JDK/JRE installed as mentioned above). There is also a shell (.sh)
version targeted to *nix systems.
A build.cmd script is also provided for compiling the sources and copying required 
resources in the proper location.

TODO
Splitting API from gui, making possible a more flexible use of functionalities for developers.
